# ML_Supervised-Learning-Project

# Goals
The primary goal of this project involves employing supervised machine learning methodologies to develop and train predictive models. These models aim to ascertain whether an individual is likely to have Diabetes by analyzing their biomarkers and medical background.

# Data Sources
Diabetes Dataset
Available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset
Provide information about the dataset(s) used, including where to access or download them.

# Technologies Used
Pandas for data manipulation, exploration, and handling datasets.
Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn:
  MinMaxScaler for feature scaling to normalize the dataset.
  Train_test_split for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
  LogisticRegression for implementing the logistic regression classification algorithm.
  RandomForestClassifier for constructing and training random forest-based classification models.
  Metrics: accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix.
